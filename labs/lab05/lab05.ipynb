She would separate herself from the practitioner with a board, so they couldn't see her, and she'd ask them to place both hands through an opening in the board. Emily would flip a coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would place her hands above the practitioner's left hand or the practitioner's right hand.

Overall, in 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n",

TT practitioners hit back and accused Emily and her family of tampering with the results, while some claimed that Emily's bad spiritual mood towards Therapeutic Touch made it difficult to read her HEF. Whatever it may be, Emily's experiment is a classic example about how anyone, with the right resources, can test anything they want!"

Spearfront is off to a good start, and reports that a whopping 94% of their flights are on-time (meaning that, supposedly, only 6% of their flights are delayed). King Triton, UCSD's trusty mascot, flew on Spearfront 100 times over the past six months, and had 12 delayed flights.\n",
