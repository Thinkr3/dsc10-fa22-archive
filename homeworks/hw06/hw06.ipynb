    "This assignment is due Tuesday, November 15th at 11:59PM. You are given six slip days throughout the quarter to extend deadlines. See the syllabus for more details. With the exception of using slip days, late work will not be accepted unless you have made special arrangements with your instructor.\n",

    "**Important**: For homeworks, the `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch careless mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). These are great questions for office hours (see the schedule on the [Calendar](https://dsc10.com/calendar)) or EdStem. Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged."

    "Over the last year, _live crystal scoops_ have become popular on TikTok. There are TikTok pages that collect and sell [crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal), which some believe have the power to heal both the body and the mind. These pages don't sell crystals individually, but rather they \"scoop\" a random collection of their inventory, put the collected crystals in a bag, and send that bag to the customer. What makes them _live_ crystal scoops is that these pages typically livestream the act of scooping these crystals for every order they receive and include the order number in the stream, so that customers can verify that what they receive is actually what was scooped. For instance, [@chloesmith.uk](https://www.tiktok.com/@chloesmith.uk) is one such page.\n",

When your order is finally delivered, however, you're disappointed to find that the total weight of the crystals you received is much lower than what you expected given what you saw on the livestream.

However, you don't know how close that estimate is, or how much it could have varied if you'd had a different sample. In other words, you have an estimate, but no understanding of how close that estimate is to the true mean weight of *all* of Shelly's scoops.\n",

Assuming that our sample resembles the population fairly well, we can resample from our original sample to produce more samples. From each of these resamples, we can produce another estimate for the true mean weight, which gives us a distribution of sample means that describes how the estimate might vary given different samples. We can then use this distribution to produce an interval that estimates the true mean weight of Shelly's scoops."

    "If you completed Question 3.7 correctly, you should have found that Shelly and Cathy's mean scoop weights were quite different. Remember, all we have access to are samples of size 40 from each seller. Would we see this large of a difference if we had access to the population – that is, the weights of all scoops ever produced by both sellers – or was it just by chance that our samples displayed this difference? Let's do a **hypothesis test** to find out. We'll state our hypotheses as follows:\n",

    "- **Null Hypothesis:** The mean weight of scoops from *Scoops by Shelly* is equal to the mean weight of scoops from *Crystals by Cathy*. Equivalently, the difference in the mean scoop weight for the two sellers equals 0 grams.\n",

    "- **Alternative Hypothesis:** The mean weight of scoops from *Scoops by Shelly* is not equal to the mean weight of scoops from *Crystals by Cathy*. Equivalently, the difference in the mean scoop weight for the two sellers does not equal 0 grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we were able to set up our hypothesis test as a question of whether a certain population parameter – the difference in mean scoop weight for *Scoops by Shelly* and *Crystals by Cathy* – is equal to a certain value, we can **test our hypotheses by constructing a confidence interval** for the parameter. This is the method we used in [Lecture 20](https://dsc10.com/resources/lectures/lec20/lec20.html). You can read more about conducting a hypothesis test with a confidence interval in [CIT 13.4](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/13/4/Using_Confidence_Intervals.html).\n",
