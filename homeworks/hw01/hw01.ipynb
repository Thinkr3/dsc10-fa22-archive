You can find additional help on these topics in [Chapter 2](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/02/causality-and-experiments.html) of Computational and Inferential Thinking and [BPD 1-6](https://notes.dsc10.com/01-getting_started/tools.html) in the `babypandas` notes.\n",

    "This assignment is due Tuesday, October 4th at 11:59PM. You are given six slip days throughout the quarter to extend deadlines. See the syllabus for more details. With the exception of using slip days, late work will not be accepted unless you have made special arrangements with your instructor. \n",

    "**Important**: For homeworks, the `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch careless mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). These are great questions for office hours (the schedule can be found [here](https://dsc10.com/calendar)) or EdStem. Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged. "

    "According to the [USDA Economic Research Service](https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17829), about 108 million people in the United States of America have completed college (received a bachelor's degree or higher). Only 220,017 of those people lived in Alaska. That's a proportion of $\\frac{220{,}017}{108{,}000{,}000} = 0.00204$, or $0.204\\%$, which certainly doesn't sound like a lot.\n",

    "However, it's hard to evaluate the meaning of this data without more information. If you could request one additional piece of data (**one number**) to better understand the education level of Alaskans as compared to all Americans, what would you want to know? Explain how you would use that piece of data to determine whether there are more people with a college degree in Alaska as compared to elsewhere in the US.\n",

In this question, we'll look at another classic book ‚Äì _Winnie-the-Pooh (1926)_ by A. A. Milne and illustrated by Ernest H. Shepard. At the start of 2022, the copyright protections of the original book (but not the Disney franchise!) expired, and so sites like Project Gutenberg are now able to post copies of the book without violating any copyright laws.

We estimated that the hazard ratio of any neurologic sequela was 1.42 (95% confidence intervals 1.38, 1.47) and burden 70.69 (95% confidence intervals 63.54, 78.01) per 1,000 persons at 12 months.
